Assuming you are on a mac - go into Applications - Calibre.app, right click - show package contents - Contents - Resources - resources - images. In here, there are several .png files identical to the default calibre icon, and i switched them all out with a png of the icon i prefered - 'apple-toouch-icon.png, library.png and lt.png' are the three i replaced. I do not know which one in particular is the actual one, but replacing all three definitelt worked.
